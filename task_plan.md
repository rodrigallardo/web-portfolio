## Key Questions
1. What UI patterns make artist portfolios feel unique and creative?
2. How can we add personality without distracting from the artwork?
3. What navbar designs feel more artistic than generic?
4. How can layout/spacing/interactions add character?
5. Should we explore asymmetric layouts or unconventional navigation?

## Decisions Made
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Research before designing | Need inspiration from successful artist portfolios to avoid generic solutions |
| Focus on oil painter portfolios | Oil paintings need different presentation than digital art (texture, brushstrokes, materiality) |
| Simplified navigation | User preference + research shows best oil painter sites have minimal/invisible navigation |
| No footer | User preference + research shows pure artist sites often omit footers entirely |
| Keep scrollable layout | Current layout works well, matches successful oil painter presentation styles |
| Subtle interactions only | User preference + "no tricks" philosophy from oil painter research |
| Skip bold typography | User uncertain + oil painter sites prioritize art over typographic statements |

## Errors Encountered
| Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|-------|---------|------------|
|       | 1       |            |

## Notes
- Keep neutral color palette (beiges, whites, blacks)
- Paintings must remain the main focus
- Professional feel is essential
- Avoid overloading with elements
- This is experimental - we can iterate
- Update phase status as you progress: pending → in_progress → complete
- Re-read this plan before major decisions
- Log ALL errors
