# Google Analytics 4 Configuration
#
# To enable Google Analytics tracking:
# 1. Copy this file to .env: cp .env.example .env
# 2. Get your GA4 Measurement ID from https://analytics.google.com
# 3. Replace G-PLACEHOLDER with your actual Measurement ID (format: G-XXXXXXXXXX)
# 4. Restart the dev server: npm run dev
#
# The .env file is gitignored to keep your credentials private.
# This is safe to commit to production as it's a public tracking ID.
